# GitHub Copilot<br>Your AI Pair Programmer


_Powered by Codex, the new AI system created by OpenAI.
GitHub Copilot writes code for you!_

All you have to do is write a descriptive function name or some comments and copilot will fill in the implementation details.

It’s not just inserting a snippet of code but is actually using the context of your project and all of the public code on the internet to synthesize new code. The more context Copilot has the better suggestions it can make for you!

Together with OpenAI, we’re designing GitHub Copilot to get smarter at producing safe and effective code as developers use it.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) uses deep learning to produce human-like text and is the most powerful language model ever. OpenAI Codex, our AI system, translates natural language to code.

# Implementation Details
With tasks like making a function that calculates the number of days between two dates developers default to a google search/stack overflow. With Copilot you simply write out a new function called “calculateDaysBetweenDates” and it will implement it for you.

Never leave your IDE. Stay in the flow!

# Autofill Repetitive Code
Have you ever found yourself writing repetitive lines of code or comments? Copilot notices these sort of patterns easily and will start suggesting the next line or even entire blocks of code.

# A Push in The Right Direction
Sometimes developers get stuck. They aren’t quite sure how to proceed with their application. They might go searching for answers on the internet. Copilot can help you get unstuck by making highly intelligent suggestions about what to do next.

# Proficient in More Than A Dozen Programming Languages
Knowing a single programming language is hard enough! Even the best developers forget specific syntax or patterns. With Copilot you can just start typing and it’s suggested solutions will almost magically provide you with good code written in your project's programming language and framework.

# Contextually Aware
Is your company picky about coding style? Maybe you’re the new guy and you don’t quite know all of their coding styles and patterns yet. With enough context Copilot will be suggesting code that is just right for your team’s project and matches all their preferences.

# It Can Implement Tests!
Developers hate writing tests! They’re often time consuming and verbose. With a little help Copilot can write entire tests for you.

# How Do I Get Copilot?
Installing is as simple as adding a new VS Code extension and logging into GitHub. It’s also available for Neovim and JetBrains.

Not happy with the suggestion? Don’t worry there are usually plenty. Just navigate through with a hotkey or mouse/keyboard.

Is Copilot getting in your way? No problem simply toggle it on and off as needed.

Don’t Fly Solo! Install copilot and start writing better code faster.
